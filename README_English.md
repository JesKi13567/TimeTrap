==================

**How To Play**

You gained the curse, the time that Sophon(just kidding) prints on your pupil is passing...

but the way to defeat it is to kill Enderdragon?!

You need to mine ores and consume them to add your time,

Put the cooked ores into cauldron one by one or sneaking on ore blocks to consum them.

==================

**How To Use The Pack**

Make sure the OPs could use commands,

put the Datapack into "datapacks" folder,

type "/reload" to use the menu. (if you are playing on plugin servers, use /minecraft:reload)

If it doesn't work, type "/datapack list" to check out whether you installed it in folder.

When it is used as zip, the second content must be "data" folder and ".mcmeta" document.
